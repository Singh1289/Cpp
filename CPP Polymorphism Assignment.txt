1. Write an inheritance/polymorphism structure of Animal class to support below main function:

int main()
{	
	Animal *animal = new Animal();  //This line should give compile time error "Cant create object of abstract class" 
	
	//My Dog name is Boss & age is 15 months
	Animal *dogPtr = new Dog("Boss", 15);
	dogPtr->talk(); //Every animal has unique way of sound
	delete dogPtr;

	//My cat name is Puppy & she is 3 month old and it is-a Animal
	Cat c1("Puppy", 3);
	Cat c2("Sweety", 4);
	
	//Use strcmp function to to compare names of 2 Cat
	if(c1 == c2)  
		cout<<"Both are same!"<<endl;
	else
		cout<<"Both are different!"<<endl;
		
	c1.talk();
}

2. Write an inheritance/polymorphism class structure for Shape class to support below main function:

int main()
{
	//This line should give compile time error like "Cant create object of abstract class" as we can't draw Shape. 
	Shape *shape = new Shape();
		
	//My Triangle's width is 10 & height is 3 
	Shape *triangleShape = new Triangle(10, 3);
	
	//Triangle's area formula is (width * height)/2 
	triangleShape->getArea();
	
	delete triangleShape;

	//My Circle's centre is at 2,2 (x,y) and radius of 3 and it is-a Shape
	Circle c1(2,2,3);
	Circle c2(3,3,8);
	
	//Please check both circles areas to verify whether they are equal or not
	//Circle's area formula is (3.14 * radius * radius)
	if(c1 == c2)
		cout<<"Both circle are of same area"<<endl;
	else
		cout<<"Both circle are of different area"<<endl;	
}
